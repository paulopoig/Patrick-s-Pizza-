<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

Patrick's Pizza is an e-commerce website my team and I built from scratch as a requirement for my Information Technology Management course. The goal was to create an online platform that could help streamline business operations for a real-world company. We searched for a suitable local franchise that could benefit from the core functionality of a traditional e-commerce site and selected Patrick's Pizza, a pizza chain based in Tondo, Manila.

Patrick's Pizza offers diverse pizza varieties; however, their records were limited to paper logs. They needed a better record storage solution since their locations are spread out across remote areas of Tondo, making them tough to locate when cravings strike. Hence, Patrick's Pizza was the perfect choice.

Our custom website incorporates fundamental CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) capabilities to help Patrick's Pizza digitize their record-keeping. Additionally, establishing an online presence opens up sales opportunities and makes it easier for hungry customers to find and order their crave-worthy pizzas on-the-go.
